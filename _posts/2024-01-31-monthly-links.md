+ [How to Use a Decision Table Methodology to Analyze Complex Conditional Actions Requirements in Software Development](https://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=39)

  > A decision table is a two-dimensional matrix with one row for each possible action and one row for each relevant condition and one column for each combination of condition states. A decision table can very concisely and rigorously show complex conditions and their resulting actions while remaining comprehensible to a human reader.

  > The first set of rows indicates the possible actions that may be taken. An "X" in an action row shows that the action will be taken under the condition states indicated in the column below.

  > In a bivariate decision table, conditions are binary, restricting condition evaluations to "yes" and "no". This results in a number of columns equal to 2 number of conditions. This can quickly result in a huge number of columns as the number of conditions rise. Fortunately, it is unusual that every combination of conditions results in a different action.
