  > A decision table is a two-dimensional matrix with one row for each possible
  action and one row for each relevant condition and one column for each
  combination of condition states. A decision table can very concisely and
  rigorously show complex conditions and their resulting actions while remaining
  comprehensible to a human reader.

  > The first set of rows indicates the possible actions that may be taken. An
  "X" in an action row shows that the action will be taken under the condition
  states indicated in the column below.

  > In a bivariate decision table, conditions are binary, restricting condition
  evaluations to "yes" and "no". This results in a number of columns equal to 2
  number of conditions. This can quickly result in a huge number of columns as
  the number of conditions rise. Fortunately, it is unusual that every
  combination of conditions results in a different action.

  > ### ISO 216

  > The most convenient and distinguishing characteristic of ISO paper is that
  each format has an aspect ratio equal to the square root of two
  (1:4142)[**sic**, _it should be 1.4142:1_] which makes it simple to enlarge or
  reduce a document for printing on another ISO paper format. The most popular
  series of the ISO standard is the A series. The most widely used paper of this
  series is the A4 format. All paper sizes of this series have a name that
  consists of an A followed by a number. The larger that number, the smaller the
  paper.

  > ### North American Sizes

  > The North American paper sizes are based on traditional formats with
  arbitrary aspect ratios. The most popular formats of the traditional sizes are
  the Letter (8.5 × 11 inches), Legal (8.5 × 14 inches) and Tabloid (11 × 17
  inches) formats. You more than likely use these formats in your everyday life.
  Letter is the standard for business and academic documents. The Legal format
  is used to make legal pads, and the Tabloid format is commonly used to make
  tabloids or smaller sized newspapers. Very little is known about the origin of
  the traditional American paper formats.
